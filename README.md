Recognition Memory Experiment Framework

Overview
The objective is to create a framework for parametric generation of Recognition Memory experiments, to support researchers at the University of Victoria. The software is web based and intended to be self contained, yet comprehensive and reasonably flexible.

Currently the program needs to be modified to detect multiple instances. Interoperability with Mechanical Turk to be addressed.
